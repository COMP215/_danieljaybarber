----------------------------

To compile this code:
	1. Open up a terminal and change directories until you are in the directory with all the code
	2. If you have a G++ compiler run the following command: "g++ *.cpp".
	3. This will make an executable named a.out in that directory.
	4. In the same terminal window enter in "./a.out" to run the program.

---------------------------

Files:
	1. README.md - What you are currently reading
	2. main.cpp  - The main file for the program
	3. Graph.cpp - The code behind all the classes in the program
	4. Graph.hpp - The header file for the classes in the program
	5. a.out     - (Will only show when you compile the program) The executable made to run the program after building/compiling the code.
